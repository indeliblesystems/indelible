<h2>Overview</h2>
Indelible's <code>diff</code>ing simplifies tracking changes into aggregations
for analytics.  .
This is a brief discussion of how analytics can be done with Indelible.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<table><tr>
<td>Indelible apikey<td>Please <a href="mailto:showmethelogs@indelible.systems">sign up</a> for the Developer Preview
<tr><td><code>Python</code><td>Tested with 2.7 and 3.6
</table>
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>You don't want any unencrypted data, or any encryption keys, stored off-site.
<li>You want incremental updates.  For example, if aggregating
orders into "revenue per day", you want to be able to see the revenue
for the current day while it's happening, not wait until midnight.
<li>You want to be able to come up with new aggregations and run them
for historical data.
<li>You want the aggregator to be highly available.  You want to run N instances
to ensure you still get updates even while N-1 fail, according to the business
    needs for the data.
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>
We've got a log of orders, and we want to aggregate them into revenue per day.
If we were using SQL, this query would work:
<code><pre>
    SELECT date,SUM(revenue) FROM orders GROUP BY date;
</pre></code>
but the SQL has some downsides: It's quite slow, and what's more, we need to rerun
the query anytime we want close-to-accurate numbers--if the orders table is
changing frequently, we may need to run this query often.
With Indelible, we can use versioning to get daily totals that are
consistent to the data we are working with, even if it's not the latest,
and we can easily update our totals to make them consistent with any other
version, forward or backward in time.

<code><pre>
    for order in orders_not_processed_yet():
        if order.is_too_old():
            continue
        if order.is_being_removed():
            daily_revenue[order.date.day()] += order.revenue
        else:
            daily_revenue[order.date.day()] -= order.revenue
</pre></code>

This would be fine if we were looking at a historical version, but our
goal is to make current daily totals highly-available, so we need to add
a transaction boundary so we can pick up if something crashes.

<code><pre>

<h2>What do we have so far?</h2>
We've got continuously-updated daily revenue totals that:
<ul>
<li>are highly-available &mdash; we can run more instances to ensure availability
<li>safe &mdash; all the data involved is encrypted end-to-end; no keys or plaintext are exposed to Indelible
</ul>

<h2>Optimizations</h2>
    If your aggregation requires lots of data, Indelible can be used to sync
    to a source that's more ideally suited to that kind of query.  For example,
    a local SQL or timeseries database might facilitate faster
    aggregations, while you won't need to care if that database gets lost,
    since it can always be rebuilt from scratch with Indelible.
